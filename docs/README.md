# PostHog Documentation

These docs explain how to use PostHog.

## Philosophy

We believe the era of 3rd party product analytics software will eventually come to end.

We strongly believe 3rd party analytics don't work anymore in a world of Cookie laws, GDPR, CCPA and lots of other 4 letter acronyms. There should be an alternative to sending all of your customer's personal information and usage data to 3rd parties.

PostHog gives you full control over all your customer's data, while being able to do powerful analytics.

We see lots of larger companies who can't send their data to 3rd party tracking services for cost or privacy reasons. They end up with a complex data pipeline into a data lake and then an analytics platform on top. Data analysts end up being the only people who understand it.

We solve that - we let every person in the company have easy access to product analytics that they can understand and use independently, even at massive scale, and without sending data to 3rd parties.
