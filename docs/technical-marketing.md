Welcome marketeers!

There are two primary objectives you can tackle using product analytics:

## Reduction in Cost Per Acquisition

You are going to acquire customers from many sources, and with different styles of advert and messaging. Each of these sources is likely to perform differently, so the end result is that all leads are not the same value.

Someone who is actively searching for a solution like yours on Google Adwords is likely to convert better into a paying customer than someone who happened to spot a display ad.

In order to reduce the Cost Per Acquisition, analyzing product behaviour can help you understand which marketing channels and messages are the most cost effective.

## Increase in Lifetime Value

Many companies have realized a lot of their growth can come from their existing users. Firstly, that means working out why customers leave, and preventing that. Secondly, that means tracking actions that correlate with increased lifetime value â€“ for example, encouraging existing users to refer others, or understanding when to push an offer to a customer to get them to return to your online shop.
