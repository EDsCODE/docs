# PostHog Roadmap

## Themes

### 1 - Parity (current phase)

The objective of this phase is to meet the product team's typical use cases of product analytics tools, in a way that developers can easily implement.

### 2 - Scalability

The objective of this phase is to enable enterprise users, with very large databases (ie Snowflake or Redis) to go into production as easily as hobbyists.

###Â 3 - Feature flags

The objective of this phase is to enable developers to assess the impact of each Pull Request or feature they build. This will turn us from a "parity" tool to best in class.
