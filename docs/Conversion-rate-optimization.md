Conversion Rate Optimization is key to achieving faster growth for your company.

You will (hopefully) have lots of visitors to your website and ultimately to your product.

Conversion Rate Optimization is the practice of thinking of this journey as a series of steps, and monitoring the percentage of users that get through each step. You can then judge where you should focus your time and effort.

## Improving sign ups

For example, if people are landing on your homepage, but only 1% of people are clicking “Start Now”, to start the sign up process, then this tells you that you should work on the content of the page to make it more compelling, or the button needs to be more obvious, or both.

## To improve retention

Funnels for conversion rate optimization do not only apply to sign ups. They could, for example, be used to monitor how many users perform a certain action in your product that you consider important to retention – such as filling out their profile properly. See the Funnels documentation.

## Best practice

To improve conversion rates:

* Set up Funnels for:
  * Your sign up flow from homepage to what you consider an "engaged user"
    * A good rule of thumb is to base that on following a user until they see real value from your product.
  * Repeated actions in the product that are important.
* Make sure any online marketing campaign uses UTM tags
* Regularly check funnel performance and segment it by the UTM tags you have set up.
* Inspect the properties of the users who convert versus those that don’t.
