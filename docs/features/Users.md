PostHog tracks user behaviour, whether or not the User is logged in and identifiable.

A short video on Users can be found here: https://youtu.be/8_SsZW1v56Q

## Viewing user list

Go to the ‘Users’ list in the left hand navigation:

![Left hand navigation - user list](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-09-at-13.43.23.png)

You will see a list of users, something like this:

![User list](https://posthog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-09-at-13.47.06-1024x196.png)

The first user has had no identifying information pushed to their profile in PostHog. That is why a string appears.

The second user has had their email address passed to PostHog.

## User history

Clicking on an individual user brings up their entire event history:

You can go even deeper by inspecting each event individually. Click on the event to bring up the event properties. This shows you the following information:

## Deleting User Data

You can also delete data on a user, this can be done if you have created data by yourself by testing or if a user asks you to do so.

When in the user history you can select 'Delete all data on this person' this will delete all information on that user permanently.
