Tracking how users interact with your application is really important. It means you can understand:

* The kinds of users that like your product
* Who doesn’t use it much.
* Which parts of your app are popular
* Which parts of your app aren’t used much

## Best practice 

There are several key pieces of functionality to achieve the above.
 
* Check out the Users page to understand how to track individual user behavior.
* Make sure you have Funnels set up for repeated use.
* Set up Actions and use Action trends to understand which parts of the product are being used a lot, or not.
